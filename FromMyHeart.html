                <p>Hi Cathreen!</p>
                <p>I know we are in two totally different places now (you're starting college, and I'm in Grade 12), but I had to be honest about this one thing for my own peace of mind.</p>
                <p>I've liked you ever since 2023, ever since I saw you playing outside from the school building. I admired your style and spirit.</p>
                <p>Now that I've seen your post about college, I felt I really had to come clean and tell you the truth: I had feelings for you.</p>
                <p>I'm not expecting anything out of thisâ€”I feel we're on different pathsâ€”but I just didn't want to regret never saying it.</p>
                <p>Thanks for being someone who made high school a bit brighter. Best of luck with your course!</p>
                <p>No reply neededâ€”just wanted you to know. ðŸ™‚</p>
